üìä Final Report ‚Äì Data Science Internship
üîç Overview
This internship involved working on two real-world data science problems using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. 
The objective was to gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model development.

‚úÖ Tasks Completed
Task 1: Bank Marketing Analysis (Classification)
Objective: Predict if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

Dataset: Banking system.

Steps:

1. Cleaned and preprocessed the data.
2. Handled categorical variables with encoding.
3. Performed EDA to understand customer behavior.
4. Trained classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
5. Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Insights:

a. Contact type and duration were key predictors.
b. Balance and previous campaign outcomes also influenced subscriptions.

Task 2: NBA Player Performance Prediction (Regression)
Objective: Predict NBA player performance based on statistics.

Dataset: Player stats including points, assists, rebounds, etc.

Steps:

1. Conducted EDA and visualized correlations.
2. Created new features and normalized data.
3. Selected key features using correlation and model importance.
4. Trained regression models (Linear, Ridge).
5. Evaluated using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error.

Insights:

Points per game, minutes played, and efficiency metrics had the highest impact.
Ridge Regression slightly outperformed Linear Regression by reducing overfitting.

üß† Skills Applied
1. Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Feature Engineering & Selection
5. Classification & Regression Modeling
6. Model Evaluation Metrics
7. GitHub for code sharing and documentation

‚úÖ Submission
This GitHub repository is the final submission for the internship project. 
All tasks are completed and notebooks are documented with code, visualizations, and insights.
